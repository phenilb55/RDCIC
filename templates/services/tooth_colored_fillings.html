                <p>At RAM DENTAL CLINIC, we provide modern tooth-colored fillings that restore the function and 
                appearance of teeth damaged by decay, fractures, or wear. Unlike traditional silver amalgam fillings, 
                our composite resin fillings blend seamlessly with your natural tooth color, creating a restoration 
                that's both durable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
                
                <p>These advanced restorations not only look natural but also bond directly to your tooth structure, 
                providing excellent support while requiring less removal of healthy tooth material.</p>

                            <p>To ensure your comfort, we'll administer a local anesthetic to numb the area. Once you're comfortable, we'll isolate the tooth using a dental dam to keep it clean and dry during the procedure.</p>

                                Modern composite materials have significantly improved in durability over the years. While amalgam fillings have traditionally been considered more durable for large restorations in back teeth that endure heavy chewing forces, today's high-quality composite resins offer excellent durability in most situations. For small to medium-sized fillings, composites perform comparably to amalgam. The location of the filling, your oral habits, and the quality of placement all affect longevity. At RAM DENTAL CLINIC, we carefully evaluate each situation to recommend the most appropriate material that balances aesthetics, function, and longevity.

                                Most dental insurance plans cover composite fillings, though coverage varies. Some plans may fully cover composite fillings only for front teeth while offering partial coverage for back teeth, considering the difference between composite and amalgam costs. Others provide the same coverage regardless of material or tooth location. Our administrative team will help you understand your specific coverage before treatment and work to maximize your benefits. For patients without insurance or whose plans don't fully cover composite fillings, we offer payment options to make these aesthetic restorations accessible.

                                Yes, in most cases, old amalgam fillings can be replaced with tooth-colored composite restorations. This is a common procedure for patients seeking to improve their smile aesthetics or those concerned about the mercury content in amalgam fillings. During the procedure, we carefully remove the old filling, clean the area, and place the new composite material. However, replacing fillings that are still in good condition is an elective procedure. We'll evaluate your specific situation and discuss whether replacement is beneficial based on factors such as the age and condition of your current fillings, the size of the restoration, and your specific concerns and goals.

                                It's normal to experience some sensitivity for a few days or weeks after receiving any type of filling, including composite restorations. However, tooth-colored fillings generally cause less long-term sensitivity than metal fillings because they don't conduct temperature changes to the same degree. Composite materials also bond directly to your tooth, which helps protect the underlying dentin and reduces sensitivity. If you do experience prolonged sensitivity after receiving a composite filling, it might indicate an issue with your bite alignment or the restoration itself. In such cases, please contact us for an evaluation and adjustment if necessary.

                                While composite resin is resistant to staining, it can discolor over time, particularly from exposure to staining substances like coffee, tea, tobacco, and red wine. The degree of staining depends on your consumption habits and the quality and finish of the filling. Today's advanced composites are more stain-resistant than earlier materials, and professional polishing during your regular dental visits helps maintain their appearance. Good oral hygiene, limiting staining foods and beverages, and not smoking also help preserve the color of your fillings. If a filling does become noticeably discolored, it can often be polished or replaced to restore its appearance.
